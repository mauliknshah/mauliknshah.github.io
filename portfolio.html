<dt> Malware Classification using Apache Spar </dt>
<dd>
  <p>Microsoft Malware Classification Challange, introduced on Kaggle in 2015, has nearly a half a terabyte of uncompressed data to be classified into 9 different categories. Each malware file in this dataset is made up of around 8500 byte-files containing only hexadecimal codes, making it almost impossible for humans to interpret. The challenge for participants is to create a model that can classify around 2700 unlabeled data files. For a bit of help, there is a subset of the data available to test the code on the local machines.</p>

<p>
To solve such a huge Natural Langauge Processing(NLP) problem, a popular distributed computing framework, Apache Spark, has been used to train machine learning models in this project. Classical machine learning techniques including Naive-Bayes, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression are utilized in search of the best solution. Additionally, a deep learning-based approach has been implemented using PyTorch. Google Cloud Platform(GCP)'s effective DataProc cluster has been used to train both the distributed and deep learning models.

<dt><h3> Solving Sudoku with Genetic Algorithms </h3> </dt>
<dd>
  Sudoku can be considered as a constraint satisfaction problem and a difficult to solve problem in limited time, in a few seconds. Genetic Algorithms (GA) are useful to solve such problems by treating them as optimization problems. For solving a Sudoku problem, this project
  (<a href="https://github.com/mauliknshah/sudokuwithGA"> GitHub Repository</a>)
  has used a GA with adaptive recombinations and mutations approach for controlling the optimization pace. Also, the utilization of the informed operators has helped in resolving a lack of population diversity during the end times effectively and efficiently. For reducing optimization time, an island model is incorporated in this GA which has improved performance significantly. As a result, the algorithm is able to solve the easy Sudoku puzzles with ease, though for solving the difficult puzzles, it requires more time and attempts.
