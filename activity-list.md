I do a lot of different interesting activities to keep myself busy and productive. Below are some of them:

1. Currently reading two books, *Think and grow rich and The laws of human nature*.
2. Working on my GitHub website to migrate my profile from my [Portfolium profile](https://portfolium.com/mauliknshah).
3. Learning Salsa dance. Apart from that, I know several other ballroom and Latin dances like Swing, Bachata, Waltz, and many more.

Very recently, I completed a series of Cuban Salsa dance classes and delivered a dance performance at Mexican Fiesta.
