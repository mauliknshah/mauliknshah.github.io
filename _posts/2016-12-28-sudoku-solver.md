Sudoku can be considered as a constraint satisfaction problem and a difficult to solve problem in limited time, in a few seconds. Genetic Algorithms (GA) are useful to solve such problems by treating them as optimization problems. For solving a Sudoku problem, a GA is used with adaptive recombinations and mutations approach, for controlling the optimization pace. Also, the utilization of the informed operators has helped in resolving a lack of population diversity during the end times effectively and efficiently. For reducing optimization time, a version of island model, a parrallel optimization approach, is incorporated in this GA which has improved performance significantly. As a result, the algorithm is able to solve the easy Sudoku puzzles with ease. Still, for solving the difficult puzzles, it requires more time and attempts.
