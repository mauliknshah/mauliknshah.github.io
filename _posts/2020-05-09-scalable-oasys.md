Maulik's theses project, under the direction of Dr. Prashant Doshi and in collaboration with Dr. Adam Eck and Dr. Leenkiat Soh, produced a novel multi-agent decision-making framework in open agent systems. This new framework can scale to hundreds of agents and allows each individual agent to make its own decision in the absence of any communication medium. Some practical uses of this framework include autonomous co-operating fire-fighters fighting wildfire trying to extinguish fires effectively and efficiently, competitive autonomous cab agents trying to maximize their revenues, etc. This research has been published in AAAI-2020, and is well received by the fellow researchers.
